== Usage

Set up whatever processes your incoming mail to pipe through rgte.  Examples:

Using .forward:

  $ cat ~/.forward
  "|exec /usr/local/bin/rgte"


Using procmail:

  $ cat ~/.procmail
  :0:
  | /usr/local/bin/rgte


Using fetchmail:

  $ cat ~/.fetchmailrc
  poll myaccount.email.com protocol imap:
    user "foo@example.com" there has password "blah" ssl
    is "foo" here and wants mda "/usr/local/bin/rgte"


Write your filters in ~/.rgte
  
  # Set up some configuration
  config :maildir_root => '/home/scott/Maildir', :maildir_backup => '/home/scott/Mail-backup'

  # Keep a copy of every email in :maildir_backup
  backup

  # sets up an alias, :me, containing my addresses
  group :me, 'scott@elitists.net', 'scott@somewhereelse.com'

  # Mark every message that's From the :me alias as read
  from(:me).read

  # Pipe the mail through spamprobe, file it into @spam if it's a hit and halt processing
  pipe('/usr/bin/spamprobe train', /^SPAM/, '@spam').halt

  # Put every message From this address into archive and mark it read
  from('automail@easydraft.com', 'archive').read

  # Email lists - list is a shorthand that matches To, Cc, and From
  list 'homebrew@hbd.org',                        'lists/hbd'
  list 'ruby-core@ruby-lang.org',                 'lists/rubycore'
